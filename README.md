## lofar_vlbi_helpers

Collection of scripts to calibrate LOFAR data for wide-field imaging at 0.3", 0.6", and 1.2" resolution. 
These are so far only used for deep imaging of ELAIS-N1 at sub-arcsecond resolutions (de Jong et al. 2024; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13247v1).

Be aware that these are not general runners, but contain hardcoded paths.
